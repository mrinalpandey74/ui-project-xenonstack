hi i'm a btech student, from <strong>electrical and electronics(EEE)</strong> branch.

Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, 
electronics, athe nd electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the <sub> 19th</sub> century after commercialization of the electric 
telegraph, telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and<sup> use</sup>

<i>
<small>Electrical engineering</small> is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including <span style="color:purple"> computer engineering </span>, systems engineering, power engineering,
 telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, 
and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science
